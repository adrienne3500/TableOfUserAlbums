To run the application:

1. Download the application.
2. Open a command prompt.
3. In the command prompt, navigate to the directory which is the immediate parent of file "server.js".
4. Enter the text "node server.js".
5. Open up a web browser (I used Microsoft Edge), and navigate to http://localhost:3000/.
